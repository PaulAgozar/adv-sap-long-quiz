## Long Quiz in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
	- Service Oriented Architecture is a design pattern that attempts to use various services to create complete applications such as those used in business, education, and other platforms.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
	Characteristics of SOAs are:
		- Loosely connected since they were designed to reduce the dependency of multiple systems. 
		- The second is location-transparent, because the services may be reached from anywhere inside the network, regardless of where it is placed. 
		- The final characteristic is that it is self-contained and is intended to accomplish an identified purpose.

3. Define Microservices.
	- Microservices is an another structural form of service oriented architecture is microservices. It is an architectural pattern that organizes loosely connected and other application services. One of its goals is for teams to be able to create and supply services for one another.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
	The advantages of employing microservices includes:
		- The convenience because a microservice may be added, removed, or updated.
		- Developers may deploy features that avoid failures
		- It is also fault-tolerant microservices that assist increase infrastructure resilience. 

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
	SOA
		- It is intended to divide resources among them, because of the bigger and more modular services are not independent of one another.
		- It usually includes the sharing of components.
		- It contains governance standards that apply to the entire team.
	Microservices
		- It is intended to host services that may operate independently.
		- There is no sharing of service components.
		- It necessitates team cooperation in order to have the freedom to determine which governance measures the service employs.

6. Define Web Services.
	- A web service is a standardized channel for communicating between client and server applications on the internet. It is a software module that is created to carry out a certain set of duties. It would also be able to give functionality to the client that invokes it.

7. List and discuss the benefits of using Web Services.
	-The web services allow the developer to broadcast their code's functionality to the rest of the world so that other programmers may utilize it in their applications.
	- Because of the ready-made web services, the cost of system development will be greatly decreases.
	- Web administrations enable many apps to speak with one another and share information and services. Web administrations are employed to make the application stage and innovation self-contained.

8. List and discuss the characteristics of Web Services.
	- There is a capability on the synchronous and asynchronous: Synchronous Web services are invoked by a client who waits for a response across current Web protocols. That makes advantage of RPC-based messaging. Asynchronous Web services are invoked by a client who does not wait for a response via current Web protocols. that employ document-oriented messaging.

	- They are loosely connected: it allows for loosely coupled system connections. It connects with each other by sending XML messages over a web API. 

	- It is XML-based, with XML used for information representation and record movement. There is no requirement for networking, operating system, or platform binding when using XML. 

9. List and discuss the distinct roles in Web Services Architecture.
	- Service Provider: the platform on which the services are hosted.
	- Service Requestor: the program that searches for, invokes, and begins an interaction with a service.
	- Service Registry: it is used to identify services and receive binding information about services while they are being developed.

10. List and discuss the Web Services Components.
	- SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol): an XML-based protocol for online service access. It is also platform and language agnostic. It is compatible with the Java,.Net, and PHP programming languages, as well as any platform.
	- UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration): an XML-based standard for describing, publishing, and discovering web services. It is used to define web service interfaces.
	- WSDL (Services Description Language): an XML-based language used to describe online services and how to access them. It is also an XML-based protocol for changing information in decentralized and distributed systems. It also allows individuals and other businesses to use the service.
